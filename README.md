# DeutscheApp

I'm currently studying German and have tried many apps to learn the language. However, Iâ€™ve never found one that truly fit my style of learning while also being free. So, I decided to create my own app!

The first feature of *DeutscheApp* is a simple yet essential tool: guessing the articles of German nouns.

Articles are a critical part of mastering German. Iâ€™m currently at the B1 level and working towards B2 this year by taking various courses. While Iâ€™ve covered topics like Akkusativ, Dativ, and now Genitiv, Iâ€™ve realized that understanding articles is fundamental. Even if you know how to apply these grammatical cases, without the correct article, you cannot use them properly.

The appâ€™s initial functionality focuses on guessing articles for A1-level words. In the future, I plan to expand its features by adding:
- New difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced).
- Additional learning tools and ideas as I continue studying and developing the app.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, Iâ€™d love to hear them! Feel free to share your thoughts or use the code as you wish.

## Get words to your app
Basically I ask ChatGPT for more words using this prompt:
```
I want a CSV file with 100 A1 German words, each with its article, separated into two columns: 'Article' and 'Word'.
Save the output as a CSV file I can download.
```
Then the CSV file will be available for download. Once downloaded, I copy and paste its contents into my main file. 

Since thereâ€™s a possibility that some entries might already exist in the main database, itâ€™s important to remove duplicates. Typically, I handle this directly in Excel after paste the new content.
``` Data -> Data Tools -> Remove Duplicates ```

## When to use das, die or der? ðŸ¤”
There are several rules you can memorize to determine which article to use, but for me, itâ€™s quite challenging to remember them all. It usually takes me a while to learn just one, so donâ€™t rush to learn everything at once. Even learning one or two rules per week is a great achievement! 

Basically to identify the correct pronoun, you generally need to look at the suffix of the word. However, there are some general rulesâ€”and, of course, exceptionsâ€”that often contradict each other! ðŸ¤¯

Regardless, hereâ€™s a list of some rules from [passion4teq](https://www.passion4teq.com/articles/der-die-das-gender-article-rules/) I found helpful, I strong recommend you to check it.

## Some Thoughts (German Tips)
I've already read somewhere that the neutral pronoun *das* appears far less frequently in German than *der* and *die*. Curious to confirm this, I checked a reliable source, [Duden.de](https://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/sprachratgeber/Die-Verteilung-der-Artikel-Genusangabe-im-Rechtschreibduden), which could confirm this affirmation:

</p>


This shows that the feminine pronoun *die* is used in most cases (45.2%), followed by the masculine *der* (33.6%), and lastly the neutral *das* (21.2%).

Based on this, Iâ€™ve thought a simple personal strategy that I'd like to share:
If youâ€™re unsure which pronoun to use, start with *die*, it gives you a 45.2% chance of being correct! If *die* sounds weird for you, try *der*. I only use *das* when Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s the correct choice. ðŸ˜Š
