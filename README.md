# DeutscheApp

I'm currently studying German and have tried many apps to learn the language. However, I’ve never found one that truly fit my style of learning while also being free. So, I decided to create my own app!

The first feature of *DeutscheApp* is a simple yet essential tool: guessing the articles of German nouns.

Articles are a critical part of mastering German. I’m currently at the B1 level and working towards B2 this year by taking various courses. While I’ve covered topics like Akkusativ, Dativ, and now Genitiv, I’ve realized that understanding articles is fundamental. Even if you know how to apply these grammatical cases, without the correct article, you cannot use them properly.

The app’s initial functionality focuses on guessing articles for A1-level words. In the future, I plan to expand its features by adding:
- New difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced).
- Additional learning tools and ideas as I continue studying and developing the app.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, I’d love to hear them! Feel free to share your thoughts or use the code as you wish.
